* I currently work at [CO Everywhere](http://coeverywhere.com) writing a pretty cool [iPhone app](http://get.coeverywhere.com).
* I used to work at [Twist](http://twist.com) writing a cool [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/twist/id449988837).
* Years ago I got addicted to xmonad and I decided to implement an OS X window manager in the same vein. It's called [Amethyst](http://ianyh.com/Amethyst).
* I occasionally put (often unfinished) pet projects on [github](https://github.com/ianyh).
* Sometimes I write about things on a [blog](http://ianyh.com/blog).
