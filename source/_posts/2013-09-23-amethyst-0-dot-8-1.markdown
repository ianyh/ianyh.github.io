Released Amethyst version 0.8.1 yesterday. I figured out some significant
improvements to its interactions with spaces. Moving windows between spaces
would occasionally fail due to an unfortunate race conditions. That's been
fixed. On top of that, each space now has its own set of layouts so no need to
switch layouts and reset layout parameters when jumping between spaces.

You can download it directly
[here](http://ianyh.com/amethyst/versions/Amethyst-0.8.1.zip) or install via
[homebrew cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask).
